> **tl;dr**: custom script which generates three word random strings are used for the article slugs on the site [üêå](https://github.com/wizardfree/gastropod)

At some point of browsing this website, you may have noticed that the articles have odd looking slugs[^1] attached to them (this very article has a pretty odd one!). 

The style of slug I've chosen for this site is based ~~shamelessly-ripped-off~~ of the [what.three.words](https://what3words.com/) location app, which uses three words to split the globe into three-worded-three-meter-squares. 

Liking the idea and wanting to implement a similar solution myself, I decided on website slugs, hence [gastropodüêå](https://github.com/wizardfree/gastropod) was born.

On the technical side, [gastropodüêå](https://github.com/wizardfree/gastropod) uses the _json_ and _random_ modules built-in to Python (did I mention it's a Python script) and a brilliant collection of words thanks to the [english_words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) GitHub repository.

Reading in the _words_dictionary.json_ file from said repo into a dictionary with the json.load function which parses a json string into a dictionary, from there it's a case of ~~psuedo~~randomly grabbing three words from the dictionary and stitching them together.

Future plans for [gastropodüêå](https://github.com/wizardfree/gastropod) are to include some checks to ensure the _words_dict.json_ file exists and implement a solution to store and check if a slug has already been used or not.

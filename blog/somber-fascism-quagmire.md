*: and those new to an IT career...this includes myself.

## Introduction
Hello there. üëãüèª

In this article. We will be discussing the common mistakes made by Junior Helpdesk Analysts. And others in a similiar position. With tips on how to avoid them. 

As a Junior Helpdesk Analyst. The majority of your responsibility is providing support to customers. But you may also be making common mistakes. These can lead to frustration and customer dissatisfaction. 

In this article, we will be discussing **five** (5) common mistakes made by those new to IT and how to avoid them.

## Common Mistakes
1. **Failing to ask for clarification on a support ticket**:
 
    When you receive a support query. It is important to ask for clarification on any questions or concerns that the customer may have. 
 
    If you do not ask for clarification. The customer may feel frustrated and dissatisfied with your support.

    Failing to ask questions especially as soon as the issue arises. Will only lead to delays in resolving the issue. Which can result in frustration, wasted time, and potentially lost revenue.

2. **Failing to follow up on a support ticket**: 
 
   It is important to follow up on all support tickets in a timely manner. If you do not follow up on a support ticket. The customer may feel frustrated and dissatisfied with your support.

   In much the same way failing to ask questions about a ticket/issue. Failing to follow up. Leads to delays in resolving the issue which in turn could potentially mean lost revenue.

3. **Little to no documentation**: 
   
   Word of advice for those in the IT industry: **Document Everything!**

   Your future-self, your co-workers, your boss will love you for it.

   Why is this an issue? Little to no documentation in IT makes it difficult to understand the systems in-place, and troubleshoot issues now and in the future. It can also make it difficult to collaborate with other teams.

4. **Not staying organised and maintaining a clean work space[^1]**:

    As Level 1/2 tech support all manner of things can appear at your desk. Whether it's a disgruntled user with laptop in outstretched arms declaring it's broken. Or it is that delivery of new equipment the teams been waiting on.

    Because of this and the nature of bouncing between tickets and communication channels it can quickly lead to a mess. 
    
    A messy desk is a messy mind.

5. **Letting pride get in the way of the job**: 
   
   If you are unable to resolve an issue with a support ticket, it is important to escalate the ticket to a higher level. This will help the customer receive a more appropriate response and provide them with a better experience.

   **Don't** get stuck thinking that _you_ have to solve every single problem that crops up. This only damages the support process. Lean on your team, that's what they're there for.

## How to Avoid Making These Mistakes
1. **Ask better questions**:
    
    Why? To provide accurate and helpful information to the customer. 
    
    Here are some tips:

   1. Open-ended questions: 

        Open-ended questions allow the support person to provide more detailed and specific information. Which can help to avoid misunderstandings.

        Examples include: Could you show me what happened? What normally happens?

   2. Specific questions: 
        
        Asking specific questions helps you to drill down into the issue.

        Examples include: Have you tried X? Is the computer connected using a Wired or Wireless connection? 

   3. Ask for Examples: 
   
        Asking for examples of how similar situations have been handled previously. Can help to ensure that the you are able to provide accurate and helpful information to the customer.

   By asking better questions, the customer can get more accurate and helpful information. Which improves the customer experience.

2. **Make time to follow-up**: 
   
   This help to ensure that the issue is resolved to the customer's satisfaction. It can also help to maintain positive customer relationships and build trust with the customer.

   This doesn't have to be a lengthy process. A simple "Is this issue resolved?" email will do. Remember to get confirmation from the user(s) before closing the ticket. Bad feeling when you have to re-open a closed ticket because it wasn't actually resolved.

3. **Document Everything!**: 
   
   Need I say anymore.
   - Notepad
   - Post-it notes
   - OneNote
   - Google Doc
   - Spreadsheet
   - TicketNow

    There are plenty of solutions out there. Don't be lazy. **Document!**

4. **Tidy up**:
    
    _Take a deep breath_ and find a solution that works for you. Perhaps the in-house Ticketing System is enough for you to juggle what needs to be done. Perhaps, like me, you find a more tactile approach useful by using sticky notes and lined note paper. 
    
    **Experiment**.
    Ask others on the team. 
    Search online. 
    
    You'll find a solution that suits you.

5. **Don't be afraid to say "I don't know"**: 
   
   Memorise the following phrase and use it often at the start of your career: **"I don't know but I can go away and find out..."**

   Ask another member of the team if they have encountered a similiar issue. Use some google-fu. Reach out to Third-Party support.

   Don't let a user pressure you into making a ill-calculated move. If it's an issue now it'll still be an issue in an hour after you've had a chance to speak to someone.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, to avoid making common mistakes. It's important to: ask better questions, make time to follow-up, document everything, keep it tidy, and don't be afraid to say "I don't know".

Remember, the helpdesk is the first point of contact for many users. So it's crucial to provide excellent customer service and support. 

By following these tips, you can ensure that you're doing your best to help the business. Whilst staying on the right track to success in your role.

Hope this helps.

Bigfoot was first sighted in 1958 but has never been caught—could the answer to this elusive beast lie in the data left behind? 🐾📊

With growing data analysis responsibilities and recent projects at work pushing my skill set to new limits, I’ve taken some personal time to develop these new capabilities—especially in data storytelling and visualisation. 📊

To put these skills to the test, I explored an interesting dataset: Bigfoot sightings, provided by the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO). 🐾🔍

Check out the dataset [here](https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data).

This report delves into: 

- 🔎 Trends in Bigfoot sightings over time.
- 📍 US State hotspots for Bigfoot sightings.
- 📆 Seasonal fluctuations in Bigfoot sightings.

This project has been an exciting opportunity to apply lessons from my recent professional work—like analyzing location data and generating actionable insights—in a creative and engaging way.

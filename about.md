Hello there 👋🏻, I'm Joseph Fleet an IT Technician with a background in Retail and a passion for big metal boxes of [thinking sand](https://www.youtube.com/c/Level1Techs). I have strong experience in troubleshooting technical issues, managing technical assets and dealing with customers in a professional environment.

Much of my time is spent in the 1's and 0's of the digital world and can usually be found ~~breaking~~ learning something new. 

Currently I hold several IT certifications: 
- Comptia
    - A+
    - Network+
    - Linux+
- Python Institute
    - PCEP
    - PCAP
- Microsoft
    - Modern Desktop Administrator

If i'm not playing around with something techinical, I can usually be found painting miniatures for Warhammer or modding Bethesda games.

Currently I'm looking for work as an IT Technician and am ready for a challenge. I can be reached at JosephSFleet@gmail.com or my resume is available at the top of this page.

Thanks for taking the time to view my page I hope you enjoy your time here. 👍🏻

Hello there üëãüèª, I'm Joseph Fleet a Junior Support Technician with experience troubleshooting technical issues, managing technical assets and dealing with customers in a professional environment.

Much of my time is spent in the 1's and 0's of the digital world and can usually be found ~~breaking~~ learning something new. 

Currently I hold several IT certifications: 
- Comptia
    - A+
    - Network+
    - Linux+
- Python Institute
    - PCEP
    - PCAP
- Microsoft
    - Modern Desktop Administrator

I enjoy the process of acquiring new certifications not only for the validation of having my skillset align with the industry but also the exposure to new technologies, a good techy can never know enough!

Currently I'm looking for work as an IT Support Technician and am ready for a challenge. I can be reached at josephsfleet@gmail.com if you wish to reach out.

Here are some links to where you can find me online. Also included are links to other websites that I've found useful or interesting.

If you run a personal page of your own I implore you to add a links page. 

By doing so we preserve the original method of discovering content on the Internet. 

Break free from the dominance of the handful of content-reguratating websites that have come to define the online experience and work towards a more diverse and free World Wide Web.
